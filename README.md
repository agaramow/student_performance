The presented paper was motivated by the low performance of Portuguese students in European rankings 
and the potential of Data Mining methods to provide an understanding of the underlying dynamics in the education sector. The authors use four Data Mining techniques, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Network and Support Vector Machines. They show that although the prediction of the performance is dominated by the past performance there are other relevant features, e.g., number of absences, parentâ€™s job and education, alcohol consumption, which help to explain students' performance.

Following the idea of Cortez and Silva (2008), I use the paper data on Portuguese secondary school student to predict their performance using tree based methods, Bagging, Random Forest and Boosting. First, I will evaluate and compare the results from the three methods using two criteria, (1) prediction accuracy measured by the test MSE, (2) variable importance measured by the decrease in RSS, and (3) interpretability. In the second step, I compare my results to the results of Cortez and Silva (2008). Third, (if there is time) I will compare the performance of the sophisticated tree based methods to a simple linear regression.
